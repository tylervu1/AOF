# Introducing “Attack on Fruit!” 

Our Inspirations!

Fruit Ninja:
Fruit Ninja is a very popular mobile game that requires users to slash through the air and destroy fruits, all while avoiding dangerous bombs. The player will gain points for each fruit they destroy, but if they hit a bomb, then they lose a life:

Superhot:

Superhot is a popular first-person shooter game in which players aim to survive and progress through varying levels of hostile attackers in a minimalistic environment. The player can use various tools to kill attackers such as guns, melee weapons, and throwables. The defining feature of this game is that time only moves when the player moves, allowing the user to dodge attackers and make well-thought-out decisions that would otherwise be impossible.

ABOUT “Attack on Fruit” 
Overall Summary
“Attack on Fruit '' will be a game where the player is continuously attacked by fruit, thrown by “fruit zombies,” and the goal is to destroy as many fruit zombies as possible to stop fruit being thrown before the player’s health runs out.

Rules
The player begins with 20 health points, and the game concludes if there are no remaining points
If a fruit hits the user, it will decrease the health by varying amounts depending on the fruit type
The user can destroy a fruit by shooting bullets that hit it
There are also enemies (fruit zombies) who will throw fruit at and slowly walk toward the player
A user may kill a zombie by hitting it with bullets
If a user kills all the zombies in a level, then they will move onto the next level




## FOUR ELEMENTS



### Story
There was nothing more you hated as a kid than vegetables. They were green, tasted weird, and, most of all, looked absolutely disgusting in school lunches. To avoid eating them, you would hide them under your bed where all the zombies lived, hoping that they would devour them for you. 

That plan backfired big time, and these fruits became the new zombies overtaking the world. Now it’s your job to stop them and to not only protect the world but also yourself against the nasty mushy greens.  






### Mechanics:
We can break the mechanics into two separate portions. One that affects the player and the other environment/opponents.
Opponent Mechanics:
Each round has a set amount of zombies of a specific difficulty level.
As each level increases, the zombies get bigger and throw bigger fruit (which inflict more damage).
Zombies will be randomly instantiated around in the environment.
User/Player Mechanics
Users will shoot projectiles to hit fruit zombies with their mouse.
Movement using WASD or arrow keys to dodge projectiles.

### Aesthetics
Regarding graphics, we want to adopt a 3D low poly game design. This approach aims to provide a more fun but efficient way to render graphics in real-time, as these graphics would take fewer computation resources to compute. This would help smooth transitions as the fruits move throughout the world across the user's screen. 

### Technology
We are planning on using Unity for the implementation of our game mechanics and Blender for all of our asset creation and animation.
