### Introducing “Attack on Fruit!” 

Our inspirations for this game come from Fruit Ninja and Superhot, which were both very popular games that focused on the player's ability to destroy hostile enemies.

“Attack on Fruit '' will be a game where the player is continuously attacked by fruit, thrown by “fruit zombies,” and the goal is to destroy as many fruit zombies as possible to stop fruit being thrown before the player’s health runs out.

### The Story

“Attack on Fruit '' immerses players in a surreal world created from childhood nightmares and Asian scoldings as a result of not liking them. The worst comments would be “you’re not growing because you don’t eat vegetables'', “you have terrible eyesight because you dont eat carrots”, and worst of all “you have acne issues because you're not eating enough fruits and vegetables”. 

Years later, you find yourself trapped in a vivid nightmare where these haunting memories return with a vengeance where the once dreaded fruits and vegetables transformed into relentless zombies seeking revenge. In this nightmare, you must fend off the endless fruits and vegetable zombies to survive. 

"Attack on Fruit" challenges players in an action-packed platform adventure where skill progression is key. Each level intensifies without introducing new skills, pushing players to master their abilities against increasingly overwhelming hordes of enemies. With infinite rounds, the objective is simple yet daunting: persevere and defeat the growing onslaught of fruit and vegetable zombies to survive the nightmare-turned-reality.

### Rules
1. The player begins with 10 health points, and the game concludes if there are no remaining points. After every level, the user's health will become full.
2. If a fruit hits the user, it will decrease the health by varying amounts depending on the fruit type
3. There are also enemies (fruit zombies) who will throw fruit at and slowly walk toward the player
4. A user may kill a zombie by hitting it with bullets
5. If a user kills all the zombies in a level, then they will move onto the next level
6. If an enemy and user touch, the enemy will explode, dealing damage to the player

### Level Progression
Each level corresponds with a wave of zombies walking towards the player. As the level number gets higher, different types of enemies are introduced and more spawning areas are added. Enemies health, speed, and strength may vary between type, but there is no way for an enemy to regain health.

There is no final level; as such, the only way to terminate the game is to die.

### Mechanics
Players can use WASD or arrow keys to move around and dodge projectiles, and the mouse the aim and shoot projectiles at the enemies.

### Aesthetics
Regarding graphics, we adopted a 3D low poly design in the characters and semi-realistic approach to design the world. There are also animations included in both to introduced a more seamless and more lifelike experience.

### Technology
This game was made using Unity for the implementation of our game mechanics and Blender for asset creation and animation.
